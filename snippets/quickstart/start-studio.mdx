<Step title="Run the local Novu Studio">
    The Local Novu Studio is where you will build your notification workflows and craft the controls that will be
    exposed for your non-technical peers to maintain after your workflow is pushed to your Staging or Production
    environments.

    ```bash
    npx novu@latest dev
    ```

    The `dev` command is your go-to command whenever you want to build and preview your changes before pushing them
    to Staging or Production. By default, it will start a secure tunnel that our Durable Cloud Workflow Engine will
    be able to communicate with, and the Local Studio web service listening on `http://localhost:2022`
