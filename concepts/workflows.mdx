title: "Workflows"
description: "Workflows are at the core of responding to events in your system with notifications. Novu Framework enables you to declare type-safe, validated, and version-controlled Novu Workflows with code."
---

A workflow holds the entire flow of steps (nodes) that are sent to the subscriber. This is where all the different channels are tied together under a single entity.

## Structure

A workflow acts as the blueprint for the notifications that will be sent. This is where all the different channels, filters, rules and actions are tied together under a single entity.

## Workflow Components

<Steps>
    <Step title="Name and Identifier">
        Every workflow will have a name and an identifier that are used to uniquely identify each workflow.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Trigger">
        The "Trigger" refers to an event or action that initiates the workflow. It signifies a call to the Novu API with a specified workflow ID, along with the necessary payload data that the workflow content will utilize.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Steps">
        In Novu, a channel refers to a preconfigured provider through which notifications are dispatched to recipients. In most instances within Novu, these channels utilize the credentials you provide to ensure the delivery of notifications on your behalf. The combination of these credentials and accompanying settings constitutes a configured channel.

        Within the Novu framework, channels are categorized into various types, each of which is linked with at least one corresponding provider that can be tailored as needed:

        #### Channel Steps
        - **Email** (examples include Sendgrid, Postmark)
        - **Inbox** (such as feeds, toasts, banners)
        - **Push** (such as APNS, FCM)
        - **SMS** (examples include Twilio, Telnyx)
        - **Chat** (such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord)

        #### Action Steps
        - **Delay** (to pause the workflow for a specified duration)
        - **Digest** (to group multiple notifications into a single message)
        - **Custom** (to execute custom logic like calling an HTTP API, database query, etc.)
    </Step>

</Steps>

## Execution of Workflow Steps

Once a workflow is initiated by its trigger, the steps (and channels) within the workflow are executed in a specific sequence. This sequential execution ensures that each step is completed before the next one begins, maintaining a controlled and orderly flow of the notification process. Here's what you need to know about this process:

- **Sequential Execution:** Each channel in the workflow is activated one after the other, in the order they are listed within the workflow. This method ensures that each step is given the necessary attention and that dependencies or prerequisites of later steps are adequately met.

- **Order of Channels:** The order in which channels are listed in the workflow is crucial, as it dictates the sequence of their execution. You should carefully consider the order when setting up your workflows to align with your notification strategy.

Sequential execution provides a predictable and reliable workflow process, ensuring that messages are sent out in an organized manner and that each step's output potentially influences the subsequent ones.
