Multi-tenancy is a common use case for a lot of companies that have multiple organizations that use their applications. In some cases, there is a need to separate the behavior of the notification system depending on the individual tenants.

Currently, Novu supports the following customizations:

- Workflow level customizations
- Integration customizations

## Tenant Management

Tenants can be created and modified via the [API](http://docs.novu.co/api-reference/tenants/get-tenants) or [Web](https://dashboard.novu.co/tenants?utm_campaign=docs-tenants). Each tenant can have multiple fields on it:

- Identifier - The identifier is a unique value, and can be used later when pointing to this tenant during trigger calls.
- Name - A human-readable name of the tenant.
- Data - A custom data object that can store information about the tenant. This data can be later accessed inside workflows.

## Workflow Level Customizations

When triggering a workflow, it is possible to pass the tenant information (id or object, in case of an object, novu will upsert the tenant if itâ€™s not existing) like so:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Node.js">
  ```javascript
    import { Novu } from '@novu/node';

    const novu = new Novu("<NOVU_SECRET_KEY>");

    await novu.trigger('<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
      {
        to: {
          subscriberId: '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>',
        },
        payload: {
          name: "Hello World",
        },
        actor: "actorId"
        tenant: "tenantIdentifier"
      }
    );

```
</Tab>
<Tab title="PHP">
```php
  use Novu\SDK\Novu;

  $novu = new Novu('<NOVU_SECRET_KEY_HERE>');

  $novu->triggerEvent([
    'name' => '<WORKFLOW_TRIGGER_IDENTIFIER>',
    'payload' => [
      'name' => 'Hello'
    ],
    'to' => [
        'subscriberId' => '<UNIQUE_SUBSCRIBER_IDENTIFIER>'
    ],
    'actor': "actorId"
    'tenant': "tenantIdentifier"
  ]);
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Integration Level Customizations

When creating an integration, you can create a condition where you can specify a delivery provider for a channel when a particular tenant id is matched.

The delivery provider specified will only be used if the trigger is executed with the tenant id.
