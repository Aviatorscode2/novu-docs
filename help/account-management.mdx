### Creating an account

Novu supports [US](https://web.novu.co/auth/signup) and [EU](https://eu.web.novu.co/auth/signup) regions based on where you want your data to be stored. In both the regions, a new account can be created using Github or Email and Password. If you are looking for other ways to signup on Novu, feel free to reach out us at support@novu.co.

### Resetting password

If you have created an account with Novu before, you can reset your password by clicking on `Forgot Your Password?` option on the sign-in page.

### Is US and EU account data synced?

US and EU accounts are completely independent. If you have created an account in the US, you will not be able to login with the same credentials in the EU and vice versa.

### Changing the email associated to my account
If you want to change your account email, please reach out to us at support@novu.co.

### What happens if I change my Github account email?

If you created your Novu account using Github, and you change your email in Github, it will not be reflected in Novu. When you login to Novu using the new Github email, a new account will be created. Please email support@novu.co to update your email address.

### How do I create a new Organization?

A new organization can be created by entering a value in the dropdown in the left bottom corner of the dashboard. As soon as you start writing something, an add option will appear. This dropdown can also be used to switch between organizations. One organization's data is not visible to other organization members.

### How can I change the name of my Organization
If you want to change your current Organization name, [rename organization api](https://novu-preview.mintlify.app/api-reference/organizations/rename-organization) can be used. If you face any issue in using the API or need any help changing the Organization name, please reach out to us at support@novu.co.
