### What is a subscriber?

A subscriber is an entity to which notification is sent. It is a novu term similar to a user in your system. As in your system, user is identified by a unique id, similarly in novu, subscriber is identified by a unique id called `subscriberId`. We recommend to your system `userId` to be used as `subscriberId` in novu. Read more about subscribers on [subscribers documentation page](/subscribers/subscribers)

### Is it necessary to use subscriberId as same as userId?

No, it is not necessary to use subscriberId as same as userId. You can use any unique id as subscriberId. But we recommend to use userId as subscriberId to avoid any confusion. Few of our customers use a pattern like `auth0|userId` as a value for `subscriberId`.

### Can subscriber credentials be added while creating a new subscriber?

Subscriber credentials for push and chat channel providers cannot be added while creating a new subscriber. Subscriber credentials for push and chat channel providers can be added using [update subscriber credentials api](/api-reference/subscribers/update-subscriber-credentials) or corresponding sdk methods. SMS and email channels is a bit different because all providers can work with same value, so `email` and `phone` [attributes](/subscribers/subscribers#subscriber-attributes) can be added while creating a new subscriber.

### What is the right approach to add subscribers?

Subscriber can be added using two ways [ahead of trigger](/subscribers/subscribers#1-ahead-of-trigger) or [inline of trigger](/subscribers/subscribers#2-inline-of-trigger).
One way to add subscriber using inline of trigger is to add a new subscriber in novu as soon as they signup in your system. Other ways is to create existing users as subscribers in novu using [bulk create subscriber creation method](/subscribers/subscribers#bulk-subscriber-creation)

### Can subscriber preference be updated while adding a new subscriber?

No, subscriber preference cannot be updated while adding a new subscriber. Novu sets all channels as true by default for new subscriebr. It can be changed later. Read more about [subscriber preferences](/subscribers/preferences).
