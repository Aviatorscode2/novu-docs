<Note>This feature is available from v0.22.0.</Note>

Rate limiting is an essential functionality for establishing a robust and resilient system. It safeguards system resources from being misused by malicious actors or being monopolized by one client.

A variable-cost token bucket rate limited algorithm has been added to provide the capability for different API controllers and methods to have a varying cost. It also lays a foundation for dynamic costing of resource consumption.

## Limits

The following limits apply to each category of the Novu system. Each category has an independent bucket of rate-limit tokens to consume.
Bulk requests have a rate limit cost of 100 times the base limit and consume from the same token pool. For example, the free tier would allow a combined maximum of 10 standard trigger events and 2 bulk trigger events in the same 1-second window.

| Category      | Free   | Business | Endpoints                                                            |
| ------------- | ------ | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Events        | 60 rps | 600 rps  | Trigger                                                              |
| Configuration | 20 rps | 200 rps  | Subscribers, Topics, Tenants                                         |
| Global        | 30 rps | 300 rps  | All other endpoints consume rate limiting tokens from this category. |

### HTTP response headers

When integrating with Novu API, itâ€™s important to consider the rate limiting HTTP headers included in the response. These headers help you manage your API usage and avoid hitting rate limits. 

```
RateLimit-Remaining: 219
RateLimit-Limit: 300
RateLimit-Reset: 2
RateLimit-Policy: 300;w=5;burst=330;comment="token bucket";category="trigger";cost="bulk";serviceLevel="free"
```

- RateLimit-Remaining

  Indicates the remaining number of request tokens in the current window.

- RateLimit-Limit

  Indicates the total number of request tokens available in the current window.

- RateLimit-Reset

  Indicates the seconds until the current window resets and the request token limit is fully replenished.
 
- RateLimit-Policy

  Defines the details on the applied rate limiting policy.

- Retry-After

  Specifies the number of seconds to wait before making another request.
