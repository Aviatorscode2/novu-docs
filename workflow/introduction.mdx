The Novu framework allows you to build and manage advanced notification workflows with code, and expose No-Code controls for non-technical users to modify.

Workflows are the building blocks of your Customer notification experience, they will define the what, when, how and where of your notifications.

## Building blocks

Each Novu workflow is composed of 3 main components:

- **Trigger** - The event that will start the workflow
- **Channel Steps** - The delivery method of the notification with the content
- **Action Steps** - Actions that will happen before and after a given channel step is executed.

Let's take a look at a simple example of a workflow that sends an email after one day:

```typescript
import { workflow } from "@novu/framework";

workflow("sample-workflow", async (step) => {
  await step.delay("delay", async () => {
    return {
      unit: "day",
      amount: 1,
    };
  });

  await step.email("email-step", async () => {
    return {
      subject: "Welcome to Novu",
      body: "Hello, welcome to Novu!",
    };
  });
});
```

### Trigger

The trigger is the event that will start the workflow. In our current example the `sample-workflow` identifier will be used as our trigger id.
Workflow identifiers should be unique to your application and should be descriptive of the workflow's purpose.

### Channel Steps

Channel steps are the delivery methods of the notification. In our example, we have an email channel step that will send an email with the subject `Welcome to Novu` and the body `Hello, welcome to Novu!`.
Our durable workflow execution engine will select the relevant delivery provider configured for this channel and send the notification with the specified content.

Novu supports a variety of common notification channels out-of-the-box, including **email**, **SMS**, **push**, **inbox**, and **chat**.

### Action Steps

Action steps are purpose built functions that help you manage the flow of your workflow. In our example, we have a delay action step that will pause the workflow for one day before sending the email.

You can also use action steps to perform other tasks such as fetching data from an external API, updating a database, or sending a notification to another channel.

Novu supported the following action steps: **delay**, **custom** and **digest**.
