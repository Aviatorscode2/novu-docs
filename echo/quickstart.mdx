## Notification Infrastructure as Code

Novu Echo is an SDK to define your notification workflows with code. Notification workflows are defined in a structured, functional way, enabling you deeply embed your own libraries and business logic into the Workflow execution flow.

Echo ships with an API Client, which Novu Cloud communicates with to retrieve Workflow Step content during your Notification Workflow. You are free to use your favourite web framework to serve the Echo API Client.

## Try it now

<Tip>
    ⏱️ It takes less then 10 minutes to setup Echo and send notifications with it.
</Tip>

To get started, just open your terminal and run the following command. After Dev Studio is launched, follow the instructions.

```shell
npx novu-labs@latest echo
```

## How it Works?

Echo introduces a new paradigm when working with Novu. Rather than being constrained to utilize Novu’s prebuilt connectors, Echo enables you to connect with your existing environment, granting flexibility to use your own libraries and connect to your own VPC during the Workflow execution.

The diagram below illustrates the Novu Cloud in grey, with your Customer environment in white. The Echo SDK exposes an API client, enabling you to serve your Workflows and their Steps via HTTP. The API can be served using your favourite frameworks, we offer pre-built connectors to make deployment easy. Novu Cloud will make HTTP requests to your Edge Server during Workflow Execution, enabling you to resolve Content and Subscribers *just-in-time*.
