# Getting Started

<aside>
    ℹ️ Node version support `>=18.17.0`

</aside>

To quickly get started with Echo, simply use the Echo CLI. Running this NPX command will start the Echo Dev Studio on your machine and open the browser:

```shell
npx novu-labs@latest echo
```

Congratulations! You are now ready to develop locally.

The fastest way to start developing your Echo Workflows is via NextJS.

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```

    ℹ️ We also offer boilerplate for popular frameworks at [Boilerplates](https://www.notion.so/Boilerplates-2e89182ffdac4b23bba64220e2643ebf?pvs=21)

</aside>

After installing the NextJS app, follow the onscreen instructions in [Dev Studio](http://localhost:2022/) to configure your Echo API Client.

See [Features](https://www.notion.so/Features-2f641647d95d459fa9719b6d81194abc?pvs=21)  to learn more about what you can do with Echo.
