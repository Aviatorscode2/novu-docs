<Note>
    Node version support `>=18.17.0`
</Note>

To quickly get started with Echo, simply use the Echo CLI. Running this NPX command will start the Echo Dev Studio on your machine and open the browser:

```shell
npx novu-labs@latest echo
```

Congratulations! You are now ready to develop locally.

The fastest way to start developing your Echo Workflows is via NextJS.

```shell
npx create-next-app@latest
```

<Note>
    We also offer boilerplate for popular frameworks at [Boilerplates](/echo/integrations/nextjs)
</Note>

After installing the NextJS app, follow the onscreen instructions in [Dev Studio](/echo/concepts/studio) to configure your Echo API Client.

See [Concepts](/echp/concepts/workflows)  to learn more about what you can do with Echo.
