See the snippet below to learn how to configure your Echo SDK client.

```tsx
import { Echo } from '@novu/echo';

const echo = new Echo({
  /**
   * Specify a custom Novu API URL.
   * Defaults to 'https://api.novu.co', for EU use: https://eu.api.novu.co
   */
	backendUrl: 'https://api.novu.co',
  /**
   * Specify your Novu API key, to secure your Echo API endpoint.
   * Novu communicates securely with your endpoint using a signed HMAC header,
   * ensuring that only trusted requests from Novu are actioned by your Echo API.
   * The API key is used to sign the HMAC header.
   */
	apiKey: '<YOUR_NOVU_API_KEY>',
  /**
   * Explicitly bypass HMAC signature verification in dev mode.
   * Setting this to `true` will enable Novu to communicate with your Echo API
   * without requiring a valid HMAC signature.
   * This is useful for local development and testing.
   *
   * You are strongly encouraged to specify an `apiKey` and set this to `false` in production,
   * to ensure that only trusted requests from Novu are actioned by your Echo API.
   *
   * Defaults to false.
   */
	devModeBypassAuthentication: false,
});
