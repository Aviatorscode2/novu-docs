Echo works out of the box with Nuxt.js. You can use the `@novu/echo/nuxt` package to serve your Echo client in your Nuxt.js application.

<CodeGroup>
```ts API Routes
import { serve } from "@novu/echo/nuxt";
import { echo } from "../echo";

export default defineEventHandler(serve({ client: echo }));
```

</CodeGroup>
