Use the digest action whenever you want to aggregate events into an array for a period of time.

```tsx
await step.digest('digest-3-days', async () => {
  return {
	  unit: 'days', // 'seconds' | 'minutes' | 'hours' | 'days' | 'weeks' | 'months'
	  amount: 3, // the number of units to digest events for
	};
});
```
