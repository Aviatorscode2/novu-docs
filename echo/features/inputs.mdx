JSON Schema provides the open standard for run-time validation of your Workflow payload, alongside your Step inputs, creating a strong cohesion between your application and Novu. This ensures that you as the developer, and your non-technical peers are speaking the same language. Those  responsible for styling and copy can edit with confidence, knowing their changes are tested in code.

JSON schema definitions can be provided in both the Workflow Options (see [Workflow Interface](https://www.notion.so/Workflow-Interface-fdd8cfcd0bed45898715c4914e8f3a7c?pvs=21)) and the Step options (see [Channel Steps Interface](https://www.notion.so/Channel-Steps-Interface-992a9c54a1a348329d284132b6c8c982?pvs=21)).

The snippet below shows configuration for the Workflow payload schema and the Step input schema. If you donâ€™t provide a schema, Typescript will infer the data type to `unknown`, reminding you of the best practice to specify your schema.

```tsx
echo.workflow('new-signup', async ({ step, payload }) => {
    await step.email(
      'send-email',
      async (inputs) => ({
        subject: `Welcome to Acme, ${payload.name}.`,
        body: `<html>
	               <body>
                   <p>${inputs.welcomeMessage}</p>
                 </body>
               </html>`,
      }),
      {
	      // Learn about JSON Schema here: https://json-schema.org/specification
        inputSchema: {
	        // Always `object`
          type: 'object',
          // Specify the properties to validate. Supports deep nesting.
          properties: {
            welcomeMessage: { type: 'string', maxLength: 100 },
          },
          // Specify the array of which properties are required.
          required: ['welcomeMessage'],
          // Used to enforce full type strictness, with no rogue properties.
          additionalProperties: false,
		      // The `as const` is important to let Typescript know that this
		      // type won't change, enabling strong typing on `inputs` via type
		      // inference of the provided JSON Schema.
        } as const,
      },
    );
  },
  {
    payloadSchema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        name: { type: 'string' },
      },
      required: ['name'],
      additionalProperties: false,
    } as const,
  },
);
```
