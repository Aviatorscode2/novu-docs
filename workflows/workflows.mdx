A workflow holds the entire flow of steps (nodes) that are sent to the subscriber. This is where all the different channels are tied together under a single entity.


## Structure

A workflow acts as the blueprint for the notifications that will be sent. The workflow encapsulates the entire flow and rules of messages that are being sent. This is where all the different channels, filters, rules and actions are tied together under a single entity.

## Workflow Components

<Steps>
    <Step title="Name and Identifier">
        Every workflow will have a name and an identifier that are used to uniquely identify each workflow.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Trigger">
        The "Trigger" refers to an event or action that initiates the workflow. It signifies a call to the Novu API with a specified workflow ID, along with the necessary payload data that the workflow content will utilize.
    </Step>
    <Step title="Steps">
        In Novu, a channel refers to a preconfigured provider through which notifications are dispatched to recipients. In most instances within Novu, these channels utilize the credentials you provide to ensure the delivery of notifications on your behalf. The combination of these credentials and accompanying settings constitutes a configured channel.

        Within the Novu framework, channels are categorized into various types, each of which is linked with at least one corresponding provider that can be tailored as needed:

        - **Email** (examples include Sendgrid, Postmark)
        - **In-App** (such as feeds, toasts, banners)
        - **Push** (such as APNS, FCM)
        - **SMS** (examples include Twilio, Telnyx)
        - **Chat** (such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, and Discord)
        - **Webhook** (used to send webhooks to custom channels or enable your customers to configure webhooks within your product)
    </Step>
</Steps>

## Execution of Workflow Steps

Once a workflow is initiated by its trigger, the steps (and channels) within the workflow are executed in a specific sequence. This sequential execution ensures that each step is completed before the next one begins, maintaining a controlled and orderly flow of the notification process. Here's what you need to know about this process:

- **Sequential Execution:** Each channel in the workflow is activated one after the other, in the order they are listed within the workflow. This method ensures that each step is given the necessary attention and that dependencies or prerequisites of later steps are adequately met.

- **Order of Channels:** The order in which channels are listed in the workflow is crucial, as it dictates the sequence of their execution. You should carefully consider the order when setting up your workflows to align with your notification strategy.

Sequential execution provides a predictable and reliable workflow process, ensuring that messages are sent out in an organized manner and that each step's output potentially influences the subsequent ones.

## Create a Workflow
The most basic Workflow to send a notification in response to an event looks like:

```tsx
import { workflow } from '@novu/framework';

const myWorkflow = workflow('new-signup', async ({ step, payload }) => {
	// Send a welcome email
  await step.email('send-email', async () => {
    return {
      subject: `Welcome to Acme, ${payload.name}`,
      body: 'We look forward to helping you achieve mission.',
    }
  });
  // JSON Schema for validation and type-safety. Zod, and others coming soon.
}, { payloadSchema: { properties: { name: { type: 'string' }}}} );
```

## Just-in-time data fetching
You can add any custom logic into your steps that you need. Maybe youâ€™d like to fetch some information about your new sign-up from somewhere else during the Workflow execution. You can achieve it with the following changes:

```tsx
const myWorkflow = workflow('new-signup', async ({ step, payload }) => {
	// Send a welcome email
  await step.email('send-email', async () => {
	  // Fetch the user from your database
	  const user = await db.getUser(payload.userId);
        return {
          subject: `Welcome to Acme ${user.productTier} tier, ${user.name}.`,
          // 'Welcome to Acme Business tier, John Doe.'
          body: 'We look forward to helping you achieve mission.',
        }
      });
      // Changing the schema from `name` -> `userId`, for type-safety.
    }, { payloadSchema: { properties: { userId: { type: 'string' }}}} );
```

We call this **just-in-time** notification data fetching. It allows you pull in data from the relevant sources during the Workflow execution, removing the need to store all of your subscriber data in Novu.

## Multi-step workflow
Now, what if you wanted to send another update to the same new user in 1 week? But, you don't want to send the follow-up if the User opted out. We can add more steps to the Workflow to achieve this.

```tsx
const myWorkflow = workflow(
  'new-signup',
  async ({ step, payload }) => {
    await step.email('send-email', async () => {
      const user = await db.getUser(payload.userId);
      return {
        subject: `Welcome to Acme ${user.productTier} tier, ${user.name}.`,
        body: 'We look forward to helping you achieve mission.',
      };
    });

    // Wait for 1 week before continuing. After 1 week, Novu will continue
    // executing the Workflow from here.
    await step.delay('onboarding-follow-up', async () => ({
      amount: 1,
      type: 'regular',
      unit: 'weeks',
    }));

    // 1 week passed, let's follow up with an in-app notification.
    await step.inApp(
      'onboarding-follow-up',
      async (inputs) => {
        const user = await db.getUser(payload.userId);
        // The `feedbackUrl` can be updated in Novu Web without changing code.
        // This helps you to create re-usable Workflow snippets.
        return {
          body: `Hey ${user.name}! How do you like the product?

      Let us know <a href="${inputs.feedbackUrl}">here</a>
      if you have any questions.`,
        };
      },
      {
        // Don't follow up if the Subscriber opted out.
        skip: () => !payload.shouldFollowUp,
        // Add validation to ensure `feedbackUrl` provided in Web is a `uri`
        inputSchema: {
          type: 'object',
          properties: { feedbackUrl: { type: 'string', format: 'uri', default: 'https://acme.com/feedback' } },
          required: ['feedbackUrl'],
          additionalProperties: false,
        } as const,
      },
    );
  },
  {
    payloadSchema: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        userId: { type: 'string' },
        shouldFollowUp: { type: 'boolean', default: true },
      },
      required: ['userId', 'shouldFollowUp'],
      additionalProperties: false,
    } as const,
  },
);
```

With this simple Workflow, we:

- Sent a new signup email
- Waited 1 week
- Sent an in-app follow-up notification

You should now have a grasp of the flexibility that Novu Framework offers.

## Workflow Interface

```tsx
workflow(
	// the Workflow name. Must be unique across your Bridge server.
	'new-signup',
	// Workflow resolver, the entry-point for your Workflow steps
	async ({
		// Helper function to declare your Workflow Steps.
		step,
		// Workflow Trigger payload
		payload,
	}) => {
	// ...your Workflow Steps

}, {
	// JSON Schema for validation and type-safety. Zod, and others coming soon.
	// https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-release-notes

	// The schema for the Workflow payload passed dynamically via Novu Trigger API
	// Defaults to an empty schema.
	payloadSchema: { properties: { name: { type: 'string' }}},
});
```


## Supported Steps

Novu Supports Channel and Action steps to be used as part of the workflow execution.

### Channel Steps
- [E-mail](/framework/steps/email)
- [Chat](/framework/steps/chat)
- [SMS](/framework/steps/sms)
- [Push](/framework/steps/push)
- [In-App](/framework/steps/in-app)

### Action steps
- [Delay](/framework/steps/delay)
- [Digest](/framework/steps/digest)

## Channel Steps Interface

Channel steps are used to send notifications to your Subscribers. Each channel can optionally configure the provider to customize content, enabling you to create enhanced content aligned with the specification of the provider. For example, you might like to use Slack blocks to send your Chat message.

All channels follow the same interface:

```tsx
await step.email('new-post', async (inputs) => {
    return {
        subject: 'You received a post',
        body: `<html><body>A new post has been created</body></html>`,
    }
}, options);
```

- `new-post` is the unique to the workflow identifier for this step. You cannot have 2 steps using the same identifier
- `resolver` function, used to return the content of the channel.
- `options` this is an optional configuration object that defines: [Input Schema](/framework/concepts/inputs), [Provider Overrides](#provider-overrides), skip and other configurations...

## Provider Overrides

Provider overrides are used to customize the content of the notification for a specific provider. For example, you might like to use Slack blocks to send your Chat message.

Those overrides are mapped directly to the provider specific SDKs, so you can use the same properties and methods that you would use in the provider SDK.

```tsx
await step.chat('send-chat', async () => {
  return {
    body: 'A new post has been created',
  };
}, {
    providers: {
        slack: ({ inputs }) => ({
            text: 'A new post has been created',
            blocks: [
                {
                    type: 'section',
                    text: {
                        type: 'mrkdwn',
                        text: 'A new post has been created',
                    },
                },
            ],
        }),
    }
});
```

<Info>
    Currently we only support `Slack` provider overrides. We are working on adding more providers.
</Info>

When overriding a provider specific behavior, Novu still requires the default content to be returned from the resolver function.
This is because the default content is used for the fallback provider, or when the provider override is not available.

## Skip Step

A step can be conditionally skipped by returning `true` from the resolver function. This is helpful when you want to use your existing user-preference system instead of Novu.
Or conditionally skip a step if it's not relevant any more for delivery.

```tsx
await step.chat('send-chat', async () => {
  return {
    body: 'A new post has been created',
  };
}, {
    skip: () => true,
});
```
