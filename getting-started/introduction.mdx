## Notification types

Novu supports different notification types, including user-generated and machine-generated notifications.

### Machine generated

- Triggered by some automated action—think a container pod scaling event.
- Notify one or more end users (which can be internal users, of course!).
- Often can be voluminous, so digests are helpful.

### Product notifications

- Triggered by end-user interactions and events within your product.
- Notify one or more subscribers.
- Typically transactional, such as order updates, password resets, account verifications, or login/OTP codes.
- Can also be used to provide product updates, such as new features or bug fixes.

### Key Differences

- Product notifications are triggered by user activity, while promotional notifications are sent at the discretion of the marketer.
- Product notifications are typically more transactional in nature, while promotional notifications are more marketing-oriented.
- Product notifications are often sent to all subscribers, while promotional notifications can be targeted to specific audiences.

## Who is Novu for?

How you use and get started with Novu depends on your role. While it’s implemented initially by engineering and development teams, Novu unifies everyone in an organization that authors, creates, sends, manages and measures results from notifications being sent to end users. Novu empowers engineers to deliver notification platforms for product teams.

### Novu for end users

When implemented, most end users will not be aware that it’s Novu behind the scenes, other than that they now receive notifications where and when they expect them.

The [Notification Center Component](/inbox/introduction) is an embeddable component that when included in your app, enables users to view and set their own notification preferences, including channel, preferred language, and more.

Novu ensures fast delivery and beautiful notification experiences for end users regardless of the channels involved.

With Novu, your app users receive instant notifications via **email**, **Inbox alerts**, **SMS**, **push notifications**, and **chat**.
