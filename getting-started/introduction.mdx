## What is Novu?

The [Novu Cloud SaaS](https://web.novu.co) platform provides an intuitive internal user interface, embeddable UI end-user components, and a code-first workflow capability.

Novu eliminates the significant burden of building, hosting, and managing a notifications infrastructure that all modern software businesses need in order to notify and engage staff, end users, and customers.

## Notification types

Novu supports different notification types, including user-generated and machine-generated notifications.

### Machine generated

- Triggered by some automated action—think a container pod scaling event.
- Notify one or more end users (which can be internal users, of course!).
- Often can be voluminous, so digests are helpful.

### Product notifications

- Triggered by end-user interactions and events within your product.
- Notify one or more subscribers.
- Typically transactional, such as order updates, password resets, account verifications, or login/OTP codes.
- Can also be used to provide product updates, such as new features or bug fixes.

### Key Differences

- Product notifications are triggered by user activity, while promotional notifications are sent at the discretion of the marketer.
- Product notifications are typically more transactional in nature, while promotional notifications are more marketing-oriented.
- Product notifications are often sent to all subscribers, while promotional notifications can be targeted to specific audiences.

## Notification channels

Novu supports all major notification channels, and integrates with multiple delivery providers for each one. Each channel can use the same source notification content, as desired.
