title: "How Does Novu Work?"
---

The Novu Framework enables you to work in your application, use your own libraries and connect to your production environment during workflow execution over HTTPS.

The Novu Framework exports the client you use to define and serve your workflows and their steps over HTTPS. The workflows can be added to your preferred framework. During workflow execution Novu Cloud makes HTTPS requests to your Bridge server for _just-in-time_ Content and Subscribers resolution.
