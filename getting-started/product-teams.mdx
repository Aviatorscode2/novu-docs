## Novu for product teams

We are well aware of the friction that often exists between engineering and product teams, and have built features that allow product teams to customize notification experiences easily and safelyâ€”without the risk of breaking important integrations and logic.

Product teams can craft beautiful notification content and campaigns in any content framework of their choice.
- Modify and manage notification UIs that engineers have built via the Novu Framework.
- Gain valuable insights into user engagement with notifications via logs and analytics.
- Use your preferred notification content editors.
- Craft impactful notification messaging, verbiage, and cadences. 
- Run experiments to improve user experience without requiring engineering effort.
