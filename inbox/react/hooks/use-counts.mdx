The `useCounts` hook is used to fetch the notification counts based on the provided filters.
You can use this hook to fetch the total count of unread, archived notifications or any other custom count based on the filters you provide.

The hook listens for changes in notification counts and will automatically refetch the counts whenever they are updated, for example, when a new notification is received.

### `useCounts` props

<ParamField path="filters" type="NotificationFilter[]">
  Filters to be applied to notifications when calculating counts, allowing you
  to filter notifications based on workflow tags, read status, and archived
  status.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="onSuccess" type="Function">
  Callback function that will be called when the notification counts are
  successfully fetched. In the callback argument, you will receive the fetched
  counts.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="onError" type="Function">
  Callback function that will be called when there is an error fetching the
  notification counts. In the callback argument, you will receive the error
  object.
</ParamField>

### `useCounts` returns

<ParamField path="counts" type="Count[] | undefined">
  An array of notification counts fetched by the hook. If there are no
  notification counts fetched yet, it will be `undefined`.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="isLoading" type="boolean">
  A boolean value indicating the first fetch for notification counts is
  in-flight.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="isFetching" type="boolean">
  A boolean value indicating whether the hook is fetching more notification
  counts.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="error" type="NovuError | undefined">
  An error object that will be populated if there is an error fetching the
  notification counts.
</ParamField>
<ParamField path="refetch" type="Function">
