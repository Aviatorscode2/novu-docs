Novu provides the `@novu/react` a React library that helps to add a fully functioning Inbox to your web application in minutes. Let's do a quick recap on how you can easily use it in your application.

1. Install `@novu/react` npm package in your react app

```jsx
npm install @novu/react
```

2. Add the below code in the app.tsx file

```jsx
import { Inbox } from "@novu/react";

function Novu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      options={{
        subscriberId: "SUBSCRIBER_ID",
        applicationIdentifier: "APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Use your own backend and socket URL

By default, Novu's hosted services for API and socket are used. If you want, you can override them and configure your own.

```tsx
import { Inbox } from "@novu/react";

function Novu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      options={{
        backendUrl: "YOUR_BACKEND_URL",
        socketUrl: "YOUR_SOCKET_URL",
        subscriberId: "SUBSCRIBER_ID",
        applicationIdentifier: "APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Controlled Inbox

You can use the `open` prop to manage the Inbox popover open state.

```jsx
import { Inbox } from "@novu/react";

function Novu() {
  const [open, setOpen] = useState(false);

  return (
    <div>
      <Inbox
        options={{
          subscriberId: "SUBSCRIBER_ID",
          applicationIdentifier: "APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER",
        }}
        open={isOpen}
      />
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(true)}>Open Inbox</button>
      <button onClick={() => setOpen(false)}>Close Inbox</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Localization

You can pass the `localization` prop to the Inbox component to change the language of the Inbox.

```jsx
import { Inbox } from "@novu/react";

function Novu() {
  return (
    <Inbox
      options={{
        subscriberId: "SUBSCRIBER_ID",
        applicationIdentifier: "APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER",
      }}
      localization={{
        "inbox.status.archived": "Archived",
        "inbox.status.unread": "Unread",
        "inbox.status.options.archived": "Archived",
        "inbox.status.options.unread": "Unread",
        "inbox.status.options.unreadRead": "Unread/Read",
        "inbox.status.unreadRead": "Unread/Read",
        "inbox.title": "Inbox",
        "notifications.emptyNotice": "No notifications",
        locale: "en-US",
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

## HMAC Encryption

When Novu's user adds the Inbox to their application they are required to pass a `subscriberId` which identifies the user's end-customer, and the application Identifier which is acted as a public key to communicate with the notification feed API.

A malicious actor can access the user feed by accessing the API and passing another `subscriberId` using the public application identifier.

HMAC encryption will make sure that a `subscriberId` is encrypted using the secret API key, and those will prevent malicious actors from impersonating users.

### Enabling HMAC Encryption

In order to enable Hash-Based Message Authentication Codes, you need to visit the admin panel In-App settings page and enable HMAC encryption for your environment.

  <img src="/images/notification-center/client/react/get-started/hmac-encryption-enable.png" />
</Frame>

1. Next step would be to generate an HMAC encrypted subscriberId on your backend:

```jsx
import { createHmac } from "crypto";

const hmacHash = createHmac("sha256", process.env.NOVU_API_KEY)
  .update(subscriberId)
  .digest("hex");
```

2. Then pass the created HMAC to your client side application forward it to the component:

```jsx
<Inbox
  subscriberId={"SUBSCRIBER_ID_PLAIN_VALUE"}
  subscriberHash={"SUBSCRIBER_ID_HASH_VALUE"}
  applicationIdentifier={"APPLICATION_IDENTIFIER"}
/>
```

<Info>
  If HMAC encryption is active in In-App provider settings and `subscriberHash`
  along with `subscriberId` is not provided, then Inbox will not load

## Frequently Asked Questions

Possible reasons for the Inbox not loading properly:
