<Warning>
  This SDK is built and maintained by our community and might not be up to date
  with the latest Novu features. We are currently working on a new official SDK
  for C#.
</Warning>

Novu's .NET SDK provides simple, yet comprehensive notification management, and delivery capabilities through multiple channels that you can implement using code that integrates seamlessly with your C#/.NET application.
