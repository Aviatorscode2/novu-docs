The Novu CLI provides a mechanism for you to synchronize your Workflows into Novu Cloud so that non-technical Novu users can control the Workflow and Step-level controls and enable your Workflows to be triggered via Novu API.

```bash
npx novu@latest sync --bridge-url <YOUR_DEPLOYED_URL> --secret-key <NOVU_SECRET_KEY>
```
