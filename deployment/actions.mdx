You can also deploy the workflow state with our built-in GitHub Action command:

```yaml
name: Deploy Workflow State to Novu

on:
  push:
    branches:
      - main
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: ðŸ”„ Sync State to Novu
        uses: novuhq/actions-novu-sync@v2
        with:
          secret-key: ${{secrets.NOVU_API_KEY}} # Your Dev or Prod API Key to Novur
          bridge-url: "https://your-deployed-servoce.com/api/novu" # This will be your target environment bridge url including that novu path
```
