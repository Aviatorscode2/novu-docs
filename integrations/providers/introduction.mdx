## Channels

Novu lets you send notifications across different communication mediums, including emails, in-app messages, push notifications, SMS, and chat. Each of these five communication mediums is referred to as a notification ‘channel’.

## Providers

Providers are what allow us to handle message delivery over multiple channels. Of the five notification channels that Novu currently supports, each channel except the ‘in-app’ channel has multiple providers.

The Inbox channel only has one provider (the default Novu provider). All the remaining channels have multiple providers.
